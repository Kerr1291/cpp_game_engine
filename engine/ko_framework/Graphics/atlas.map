{
This file is the atlas info used to map the texture coordinates for the atlas
Data Format:
  numTextures <- label must be exact, value must match number of textures
  #_name = <- label must be exact, value has the name of the texture to be looked up
           Additonal note: #'s must be in order, beginning with 0
		                   Final # must be 1-numTextures, so a 9 for 10 textures
  <name>_pos =
  <name>_size =  <- both _pos and _size labels required for each texture
                    <name> should be whatever value you listed above
					
  Example:
   numTextures = 1
   0_name = myTexture
   myTexture_pos = 0 0
   myTexture_size = 100 100
   
   ^the atlas above stores one texture at 0 0 of size 100 100

This file is the atlas info used to map animation texture coordinates in the atlas
Data Format:
  numAnimations <- label must be exact, value must match number of textures
  #_name = <- label must be exact, value has the name of the texture to be looked up
           Additonal note: #'s must be in order, beginning with 0
		                   Final # must be 1-numTextures, so a 9 for 10 textures
  <name>_pos =
  <name>_size =  
  <name>_frames =  
  <name>_spacing =  
  <name>_speed =  
  
  ^- both _pos and _size labels required for each texture
                    <name> should be whatever value you listed above
					
  Example:
   TODO put one here
